Monitoring efforts indicated that the survival of coral recruits in rubble areas was drastically lower than in reference sites and that coral recovery is not occurring in rubble areas. From 2008 to 2012 the Trustees monitored the recruitment and survival of corals to determine whether coral recovery was occurring in the response-caused rubble areas.","The removal activities resulted in dislodged, broken and buried coral resources, along with fractured reef foundation that caused large amounts of coral rubble. The Trustees estimated that approximately 7,541 meters² of impacted coral reef were associated with the incident, including the loss of 54,623 hard corals and 112,151 soft corals for a total of 166,774 corals lost.","$4,403,590.98 (settlement offer) + $794,183.46 (potential contingency)",

The vessel grounded on a rocky shoreline within a designated natural reserve with known coral reef habitat. During response efforts, the USCG used anchors and tow lines to stabilize the M/V Jireh and secure platforms for the salvage operation. These cables and anchors dislodged, damaged, and broke an estimated 950 corals, including 12 colonies of Elkhorn coral (a federally threatened species).","The cables and anchors dislodged, damaged, and broke an estimated 950 corals, including 12 colonies of Elkhorn coral (a federally threatened species).
